# Autoexec.bat

Is just the old legacy batch file that runs with everything disabled for when I game, killing all the non essential services and scumware.
shell:startup remove DnD short cuts that are junk. This file is for when I do a clean install, perhaps with win11. Instead of toggling in everything manually 
it's just drag and drop SuperKey R shel:startup folder..
msconfig hide all MS services, to investigate all unknowns and their functions, kill all the non essential inc MS services. and keep a log of the disabled and enabled to 
catch if something "installs itself"
services.msc  kill bloat ware ~ disable more TSRs, apps, program that kills CPU and RAM, and stuff that kill performance like effects such as aero peak, eye candy etc. 
Scumware, cramware, Nagware, Crapware, Bloatware etc

## Things todo

write down names of all things in these menus (in my little black book) and determine if they are scumware via my sick and twisted sence of morality and terminate them! With Extreme prejudice !!
